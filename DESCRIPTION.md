## Introduction

If you're reading this, is because either you love Slack, or just need to work with it's API somehow. Recently I
had to start implementing a bot in Slack which content was more complex that usual. Then, I found that Slack API was
quite easy to use but.... it's views, those contents in json can be soooo huge and complex, that I realized I spent
most of my time designing templates instead of coding the logic of the bot.

This is when I started to look around searching for some library that would allow me to code my views in Python easly,  unfortunately I didn't found any (hey, if it does exist, please let me know, I had no idea about it) so I decided to
write this one.

The lib, includes "almost" all Block types, I just left out those that I was not gonna use for sure, but once you see
the source code you'll realize it can be extended to included those pretty easily.
